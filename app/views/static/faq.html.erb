  <h2 id="why-just-edinburgh">Why just Edinburgh?</h2>
  <p>TDB wants to solve the headaches of booking theatre digs, but Rome wasn’t built in a day. We are running this ‘Beta‘ service in Edinburgh, to start with, to iron out all the creases and we’ll roll-out to the rest of the UK once we’re satisfied we can do the best job possible. To be informed when new theatres and towns come online email us at <a href="mailto:newsletter@theatredigsbooker.com">newsletter@theatredigsbooker.com</a></p>

  <h2 id="whats-it-all-about">What’s it all about?</h2>
  <p>You’ve got the job!!! Congratulations! Now begins the nightmare of booking your digs. If you’re lucky you get an email with the latest digs lists from all the theatres you are visiting. Then you have to print them off, then you have to sift through them, then:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>they’re in no useful order,</li>
    <li>there’s no pictures,</li>
    <li>there are no maps or distances from theatres,</li>
    <li>there’s no reviews or rating system,</li>
    <li>they’re out of date,</li>
    <li>there’s no way of booking without calling each provider,</li>
    <li>the providers may be out,</li>
    <li>the providers may be fully booked,</li>
    <li>the prices may have gone up,</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <p style="width:100%;text-align:center">...and on and on....</p>
  <p>TDB provides an online solution to your digs nightmare. Simply choose the theatre, choose the number and type of rooms and hit ‘Find Digs’. If you have a ‘tour code’, sign in and there you have an up-to-date, fully searchable database with pictures, reviews, maps, accurate distances from the theatres and the brand new booking system.</p>

  <h2 id="why-should-i-register">Why should I register?</h2>
  <p>If you don’t have a login password, don’t worry! Just contact us with your Equity, Spotlight, Bectu, Musicians’ Union or SMA membership details. If you don’t have any of these and/or don’t have a company manager just email us explaining the situation and we will process your request as quickly as possible.</p>

  <h2 id="what-is-the-tour-code">What is the ‘Tour Code’?</h2>
  <p>This code is given to your company manager/tour manager or anyone in charge of your tour and is unique to your production. Contact them for the code and if they haven’t got one, please ask them to contact us. We’re trying to get all current tours on the site but some can slip through the net so your help is greatly appreciated.</p>

  <h2 id="why-do-i-need-a-tour-code">Why do I need a ‘tour code’?</h2>
  <p>Many theatre digs providers are private individuals who offer rooms in their private homes. These rooms are not available to the public but are instead only offered to the touring theatre community. By being exclusive, theatre digs are often much cheaper than the equivalent guest rooms in the area. By ensuring that only theatre professionals can view their profiles more private digs providers use this site and as a result TDB are able to offer you more choice.</p>

  <h2 id="what-if-i-dont-use-a-tour-code">What if I don’t use the ‘tour code’?</h2>
  <p>No problem! You can still search the publicly viewable accommodation and choose to view the results in which ever priority you choose - greatly improving your digs finding experience.</p>

  <h2 id="what-about-tax">What about tax?</h2>
  <p>Did you know you are able to earn up to £4250 per year from renting your room out before paying tax on that amount? For more info goto the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/index.htm">HMRC</a> website and search for ‘Rent a Room’.</p>
